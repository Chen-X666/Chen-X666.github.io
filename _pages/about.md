üëã About
======
I am Xin CHEN, a first-year joint Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/), under the supervision of [Prof. Min YANG](https://minyang.me/) and [Prof. Shujian HUANG](http://nlp.nju.edu.cn/huangsj/). Previously, I completed my postgraduate studies at the [University of University](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/), where I was guided by Prof. Angle Ojukwu. I earned my undergraduate degree at [Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai](https://english.bnuz.edu.cn/), Zhuhai, under the mentorship of [Prof. Jing YANG](https://rsgyy.bnu.edu.cn/yjjg/yykxyjzx/rcdw2/97903.html) and Prof. [Prof. Ying JIANG](https://rsgyy.bnu.edu.cn/yjjg/glcxyjzx/glcxyjzxrcdw/97671.html).

My research interests encompass Privacy-preserving and Trustworthy AI, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to real-world scenarios such as healthcare and finance, and the detection of AI-generated content (AIGC).

‚ùóÔ∏è News
======
- **[2025-08-01]** One Paper accepted by **Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL)** as first author: *[RepreGuard: Detecting LLM-Generated Text by Revealing Hidden Representation Patterns]()*. We propose RepreGuard, a low-overhead, highly generalizable, and interpretable detector, based on the observation that there are significant differences in neural activation patterns when LLMs process LLM-generated text versus human-written text.
- **[2025-04-03]** Our new preprint *[Understanding Aha Moments: from External Observations to Internal Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02956)* released. We reveal that "aha moments" help LRMs solve complex problems by using anthropomorphic language, adjusting uncertainty, and preventing reasoning collapse, while internally balancing self-reflection with reasoning and adapting to task difficulty.
- **[2024-06-15]** Our paper related with the **Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)** has subbmited to EMNLP 2024. Arxiv: *[A Hopfieldian View-based Interpretation for Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12255)*. 
- **[2024-02-15]** Fortunately, I was honored with the *[Dean‚Äôs List Award for Oustanding Academic Achievement](https://chen-x666.github.io/portfolio/)* at the University of Southampton.
